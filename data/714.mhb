He That Is Down Needs Fear No Fall
John Bunyan

He that is down needs fear no fall,
He that is low, no pride;
He that is humble ever shall	
Have God to be his guide.

I am content with what I have,
Little be it or much;
And, Lord, contentment still I crave,
Because thou savest such.

Fullness to such a burden is
That go on pilgrimage;
Here little, and hereafter bliss,
Is best from age to age.
